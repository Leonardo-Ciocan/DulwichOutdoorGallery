##Team3M - Dulwich Outdoor Gallery

####Contributing tips
It would be best if you could make a new branch "add/my-feature" and then submit a pull request for someone else to merge.

Note : the gmail is `dulwichoutdoorgallery@gmail.com` and the password is `androidstudio`

####Notes on assigned tasks
######Quiz
A basic implementation of this would need to let the user scroll through 5 pictures at the top , the last 4 should be labeled A,B,C,D. 

There should be corresponding buttons at the bottom.

Think about how many of these are in a quiz and maybe what is shown after the quiz ends

#####Badges
A list of badges with icons (they can be the same one icon for now) , title , description.

 A badge that is not earned should be more transparent(alpha property)

#####Map
~~The API key needs to be integrated in the app ,as well as permissions.~~

It must go through a dummy list of Art and draw the markers on the map.

Maybe a ListView is shown when the user presses the list button.

Or the popover from the bottom when a marker is clicked.
